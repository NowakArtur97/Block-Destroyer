## General info

A 2D computer game from the Brick Breaker genre. 
It offers three different levels with different rules and scenery: party level, dark forest level and space level.
The player also has the option of collecting four different special super powers such as a fireball or extra life.
This is my first game made using Unity as part of the repetition of knowledge gained from the course: Complete C# Unity Developer 2D: Learn to Code Making Games (which I recommend to anyone interested in creating games).
